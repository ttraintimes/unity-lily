the item Model / Normals and Tangents.
Normals:
Calculate

Smooting angle = 180
Tangents
Calculate Legacy

Very low FPS, to increase FPS calculation :
it is possible to resize compress  textures ,to obtain a higher value  of fps:
select single image ,inspector pannel:
 ,Max size 8192,  resize and change  4096 or 2048 or lower
the lower the compression the higher the FPS will rise




this pack compatible Only legacy not compatible with other 	
typology of animations
however, you can try to convert legacy to try the following:
